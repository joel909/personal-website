            Please note: I do not consent to sharing my Instagram profile—it's reserved exclusively for people I know personally. Maintaining boundaries on social platforms is part of a healthy digital policy, and I encourage others to do the same. The Instagram button is merely a space-filler (graphic symmetry is a cruel master). All other links are valid and intended for connection. Thanks for understanding—and for not being weird about it.
