        <h1 class="im-joel">My Journey</h1>
        <h1 class="read-a-little">Read a little about how it all started! (for me ofc)</h1>
        <p class="journey-desc">
            Okay, So here is how it all began..
        </p>
        <p class="journey-desc-2">
            It all began when I was almost about (rough guess) 7, 8 or maybe 9 years old, you might think I started coding at that age, but no I didn't and instead I loved playing games, (well yes) back then I had a Windows 7 Dell laptop in which I used to play GTA Vice City (Ikr soo cool). I played it with friends and my uncles and I really loved playing it and after a while I came across some limitations in the game, like I wanted to be able to have more malls, more weapons and more cars and then I started dreaming about that world (I still have the habit of dreaming (A LOT)) then I'm like ditch this shit it's not worth my time I wanted to play something better and by that I wanted to play my own version of the game so I started with the question "how can I make my own version of this game?" and I remember this very distinctly it's probably a childhood memory that I remember the most and my dad told me u need to code, and like the kid (I still am like this) I was I'm like I'll do it he told me you need to do, this that blah blah and he's like it's hard (Don’t really remember what happened) but I fought and cried  and I guess he agreed to teach me but god knows why he taught me PowerPoint Word Excel FOR WHAT? even I didn't fully understand (I still don't) and then finally in 4th or 5th I learnt SCRATCH the nearest I got to coding I was fascinated it was amazing I could create stuff I imagined make a car race, make a sprite jump AMAZING but soon I explored everything and got bored and all, cuz I was better than that and I'M LIKE I WANNA CODE!! then time passed and finally in 5th my dad brought me a Python book for my birthday and it seemed sooo overwhelming cuz there were so many things (little context I had python on my laptop did the basics but never went past that) that book taught you how to make games (by then I forgot about GTA game) I followed through learnt a bit and then life caught up with me and that fire died.
        </p>
        <p class="journey-desc-2">
            then came 6th I was fascinated by robots and everything else I'M LIKE WTF THIS SHIT IS AMAZING, tho it was a pretty shallow industry back then nowhere near the AI hype rn I'M LIKE ITSSS CRAZZYY (I was too young for that again) I talked and talked with my dear friend Shailesh at that time about building robots our lunch break convos were just this and some school drama which I never liked (To this day I don't like dealing with people and their problems) then I'M LIKE I'M GOING TO BUILD ONE. That's when COVID struck so to reach my goal I finished learning python and I brought a Raspberry Pi for the purpose but then I realised without AI my robot is just going to be hardcoded (in between I made some cool projects as well) and then at 7th I started learning AI but how far could I have gotten, well I learnt plenty of AI theory but barely understood practicallity cuz I was small (in between I learnt APP DEV made a chat application for privacy with friends cuz I was using my mom's phone back then, also made a watering application with MQTT to water my plants) well all that AI theory came back to me when I was in 9th and 10th where I scored a centum (full marks) in AI IN BOARDS and I was chilling the day before my boards and I didn't study shit and then I went on to learnt Web Development and it was amazing I did it for a startup called Klide to build it but I ended up learning web dev, which to this day I love doing I love making solutions to problems and using tech for it is my favourite now. I kinda am doing JEE (I really don't want to it's just the FOMO) but I now want to venture back into AI cuz I feel I have the math basics for it and it's not cuz of the hype (I learnt AI way back even before the hype) but cuz I want to fulfil my dream of building robots and solving bigger problems with AI 
        </p>
        <p class="journey-desc-3">
            And thats the end of my wonderfull journey until now(17 years) and to put it in simple words, my curiosity for things around me shaped my coding journey well its been over 8-9 years since this realationship started and its still going pretty strong, unlike most people who give up when they see an error I've been doing this with patience and I've faced plenty of ups and downs but I still kept going and most of my achievements in life are also coding related (also sports) more hackathons and presentations of my projects has given me a lot of appreciation. well I really hope you found this to be a very simple story
