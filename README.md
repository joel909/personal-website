# Personal Website

This project is a simple static personal website hosted using GitHub Pages. It contains the following main pages:

- **index.html**: The main landing page introducing the site.
- **404.html**: A custom 404 error page that shows up when someone visits a non-existent page on your site.
- **insta.html**: A dedicated page highlighting or linking to my Instagram.

## Project Structure

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build and host a simple personal website as a static site. You can easily modify the files here and push updates—GitHub Pages will automatically publish your changes.

- To customize, edit `index.html` for your homepage, `404.html` for your custom error page, and `insta.html` for your Instagram highlights or links.
- Add images, CSS, or JavaScript as needed for your style and features.

## Want More Than a Static Page?

If you'd like to move beyond a static site and add dynamic features (e.g., forms, authentication, or database integration), check out my other project which implements the same website using Flask (a Python web framework):

➡️ [Flask version of this website](https://github.com/joel909/Person-ite--my_personal_website)

With the Flask version, you can add more advanced functionality and run the website on your own server or deploy it to platforms like Heroku or Vercel.
